## AEO Management System Blueprint

### Documents in Scope
- **BRD** `V1.11.md` *(Arabic)* — Business Requirements document defining processes, data, rules, roles, questionnaires, and templates for the Authorized Economic Operator (AEO) Management System.
- **SRD** `V1.2.5.md` *(English)* — System Requirements document detailing technical architecture, integrations, flows, performance, security, migration, and non-functional requirements for the same system.

### Complementary Purpose
- **BRD (WHAT)**: Captures business logic, workflows, data fields, bilingual requirements, and stakeholder responsibilities for the AEO program.
- **SRD (HOW)**: Translates BRD needs into implementable system capabilities across portals, integrations, and technical controls.
- Combined, they ensure the UAE’s GCC AEO initiative satisfies both business expectations and system feasibility.

### Agile Delivery Strategy
1. **User Stories** — Extract enhanced-format stories grouped by portals.
2. **Project Backlog** — Organize stories into epics/features with priority and acceptance criteria.
3. **Sprint Planning** — Allocate prioritized backlog into sequenced sprints with estimates and goals.

### Clarified Working Agreements
- **Grouping**: User stories organized by system portals (Commercial Establishment Portal, Local Customs Portal, Federal Customs Portal).
- **Story Format**: Enhanced template including acceptance criteria, references (`BRD: <Process>` | `SRD: <Section>`), business rules, dependencies, and MoSCoW priority.
- **Traceability**: Use Format Example 2 linking directly to BRD processes and SRD sections.
- **Priority Framework**: MoSCoW (Must, Should, Could, Won’t Have).

### Delivery Phases & Status
- [x] **Phase 1 — Account Creation & AEO Authorization Request** (≈25–30 stories)
- [x] **Phase 2 — Self-Assessment Questionnaire** (≈20–25 stories)
- [x] **Phase 3 — Validation & Risk Assessment** (≈30–35 stories)
- [x] **Phase 4 — Assessment Reports & Control Plans** (≈20–25 stories)
- [ ] **Phase 5 — Certificate Management & Appeals** (≈25–30 stories)
- [ ] **Phase 6 — System Administration & Configuration** (≈20–25 stories)
- [ ] **Phase 7 — MRA & Federal Management** (≈15–20 stories)

### Next Steps
- Finalize enhanced-format user stories per portal with BRD/SRD traceability.
- Build the comprehensive backlog structured by epics/features.
- Sequence backlog into sprint plan with estimates and sprint goals once backlog is locked.
